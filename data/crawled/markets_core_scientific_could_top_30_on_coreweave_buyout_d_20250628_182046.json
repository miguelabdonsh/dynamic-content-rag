  "content": "Core Scientific Could Top $30 on CoreWeave Buyout Deal: Cantor Fitzgerald\nA new Cantor Fitzgerald report argues that bitcoin miner Core Scientific is worth far more than the markets believe thanks to its strategic role in powering AI.\nJun 27, 2025, 7:20 p.m.\n(Kanchara/Unsplash)\nWhat to know:\nIn a research note released late Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald says Core Scientific (CORZ) could fetch over $30 per share in a , citing both the long-term cash flows from its AI contracts and the replacement value of its data centers.\nThat would be a near doubling from the current level just above $16.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.\nSign me up\nThe note came hours after _The Wall Street Journal_ reported that CoreWeave, a cloud AI compute firm, is once again in advanced talks to acquire Core Scientific, following a failed $5.75 per share offer in 2024.\nCORZ shares jumped 33% to close over $16 Thursday, but Cantor believes that it still undervalues the company by at least 50%.\nAt the heart of the bull case is a 12-year, $3.5 billion infrastructure lease Core Scientific signed with CoreWeave in 2024 to provide 200 megawatts of AI capacity.\nCantor values the lease stream at $24/share, using a conservative 15x profit multiple typical for traditional data center REITs. Add another $11.70/share for the replacement value of CORZ’s 570MW of power infrastructure, and the upside case becomes clear.\nThe BTC - AI Pivot\nBut it’s not just Cantor arguing that the compute power used for crunching numbers to mine BTC might be more efficiently used for AI.\nRittenhouse Research, a new fintech and AI-focused firm, arguing that the most successful crypto companies aren’t doubling down on bitcoin. Instead, they’re pivoting to become AI infrastructure providers.\nWhen Galaxy Digital bought the Helios data center in late 2022, it seemed like a rescue of a struggling miner, yet it turned out to be a strategic AI asset as demand for data center space surged with the rise of ChatGPT and LLMs, Rittenhouse pointed out.\n“The infrastructure used to mine digital gold is better used to process AI algorithms,” Rittenhouse wrote at the time.\nAt the core of the argument is the belief that AI generates stable, long-term cash flows, unlike BTC mining, which is subject to sharp revenue drops every four years due to halvings and is heavily dependent on bitcoin’s volatile price cycles.\nThe future profitability of BTC mining, Rittenhouse noted, is also dependent on mining firms being able to design chips that are significantly more efficient each cycle to account for the halvening, an increasingly difficult task as gains from silicon shrinkage begin to plateau.\nBut Not Every Pivot Away from BTC is Successful\nWhile Cantor, and the market broadly, is looking fondly on Core Scientific's possible pivot, not all pivots away from BTC mining have gone this well.\nCanaan, once hoping to diversify into AI hardware, has entirely after failing to gain traction. Its stock is down nearly 75% in the last six months, and closed at 63 cents on Thursday.\nBut Core Scientific might have found the middle path, leveraging its mining-built footprint to tap into a $100 billion-plus AI infrastructure boom.\nIf Cantor’s thesis proves right, CoreWeave’s second offer for CORZ could look very different , and it could mark a new blueprint for the rest of the sector.\nNeither CoreWeave nor Core Scientific has publicly commented on the matter.\nTop Stories\nThis is your last article this month.\nCookie Settings\nNewsletters\nWe and our 909 partners store and access personal data, like browsing data or unique identifiers, on your device.
