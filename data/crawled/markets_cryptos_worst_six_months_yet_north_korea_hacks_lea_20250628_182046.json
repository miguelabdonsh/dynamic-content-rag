North Korea Hacks Lead to $2.1B in Thefts\nNorth Korea-linked attacks have resulted in over $1.6 billion in losses, a TRM Labs report released Friday said.\nJun 27, 2025, 11:58 a.m.\nWhat to know:\nCrypto investors lost over $2.1 billion to hacks and exploits in the first half of 2025, marking the worst six-month period on record for crypto security and an indication of some nation-states intensifying their cyber campaigns in the crypto space.\nThe 75 recorded incidents crossed the previous H1 high from 2022 by roughly 10% and nearly match the entire 2024 total, a released Friday said. But raising alarms is who is doing a major part of the stealing.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.\nSign me up\nResearchers say North Korean-linked groups are responsible for $1.6 billion, or 70% of all stolen funds this year.\nAt the center of the surge is the $1.5 billion Bybit hack in February, now believed to have been carried out by North Korea, marking the largest crypto theft in history and skewing the year’s average hack size to $30 million — or double last year’s levels.\nThe threat isn’t limited to Pyongyang. On June 18, a group believed to be linked to Israel, Gonjeshke Darande (Predatory Sparrow), stole $90 million from Iranian exchange Nobitex, reportedly in retaliation for the platform’s alleged role in sanction evasion.\nThe stolen funds were sent to vanity addresses (which are un-spendable by design and sent tokens are deemed burnt), suggesting a political motive over profit.\nAttack vectors are evolving fast. Over 80% of stolen funds stemmed from infrastructure-level breaches, including private key thefts and front-end hijacks.\nThese attacks, often involving social engineering or insider access, are proving to be ten times more lucrative than traditional smart contract exploits. DeFi vulnerabilities, including flash loan and reentrancy attacks, which were prevalent in 2021-22, accounted for a relatively small 12% of the losses.\n_Read more:_\nTop Stories\nCookie Settings\nNewsletters\nWe and our 909 partners store and access personal data, like browsing data or unique identifiers, on your device.
