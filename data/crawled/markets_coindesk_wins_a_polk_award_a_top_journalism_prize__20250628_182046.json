Allison got to work finding evidence and nailed it by obtaining the company’s balance sheet, which was not a public document.\nIt showed that a significant portion of Alameda’s billions of dollars in assets was secretly made up of FTT, a sort of digital Monopoly money issued by Bankman-Fried’s better-known FTX crypto exchange.\nThe resulting story raised concerns about the stability of Alameda and FTX, and called into question Bankman-Fried’s image as a white knight capable of backstopping struggling companies and as an “adult in the room” in a field notorious for fly-by-night outfits and scammers. The article debuted in a world where FTX was fast becoming a household name thanks to a marketing blitz featuring Larry David, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.\nWithin days the price of FTT plummeted and Bankman-Fried agreed to a bailout from rival exchange Binance. Almost immediately, Binance got cold feet, as revealed by from Allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market. Hours later, Binance it was backing out of the deal.\nWang, a deputy managing editor, provided the honored by the Polk Awards: A story revealing that Bankman-Fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury Bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies – including the fact that Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had once been a couple. The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a issued soon after on FTX’s extremely lax administrative procedures.\nNine days after Allison’s initial story, Bankman-Fried’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection. Not long after, Bankman-Fried was arrested and the U.S. Congress held hearings.\n_Read More:_\nMarc is a veteran journalist with more than 25 years' experience, including 17 years at the trade publication American Banker, the last three as editor-in-chief, where he was responsible for some of the earliest mainstream news coverage of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\nTop Stories\nCookie Settings\nNewsletters\nWe and our 909 partners store and access personal data, like browsing data or unique identifiers, on your device.
